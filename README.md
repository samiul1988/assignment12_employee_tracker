## My Actions and Notes

* The project was developed from scratch.
* Basic considerations were as follows:
    * Following packages were used in the assignment: MySQL2, Inquirer, console.table and dotenv 
    * The database configuration information was saved in a local .env file
    * No test files have been added since there was no specific instruction to add test cases
    * Validation was considered while obtaining user input using Inquirer prompt
    * The query functions were organized in a class called ```Query```
    * Demo data was inserted using a ```seed.sql``` file 
    * Added UNIQUE constraints to the department name, role title and employee (first name + last name) since majority of the selections are based on names
