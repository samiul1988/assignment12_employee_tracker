### Link of Walkthrough Video
The walkthrough video demonstrates the following:
* all four test suites passing
    * Due to time limitation, I ran all four tests together using ```npm test```
    * In the demo run shown in the previous section, I ran individual test as well as full test to show that individual components have also passed
* how a user would invoke the application from the command line
* how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application
* a generated HTML file that matches the user input
    * when a Github link is clicked, it shows the asssociated github profile in a new tab
    * when an email is clicked, it opens the default email program and populates the TO field of the email with the address
